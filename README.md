# Toscrape webscraping project with BeautifulSoup and requests
The main idea behind the project was to choose to scrape the quotes or the books from <b>https://toscrape.com/</b> in case of books just retrieve the name and price, in case of quotes retrieve the quote and author.

This is a very basic project just to understand, relearn and fix the knowledge of BeautifulSoup and request when used together.
